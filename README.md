A simple HTTP server to practice Computer Networking, Sockets, Multithreading etc..

features (ongoing):
    - Server only allows one connection at a time, one browser connected to the server and were going to serve a page to that browser
    - its really dumb, only sends a hardcoded page to the browser, it ignores any request from the browser.
    - I will handle multithreading and http in the future.
